It must be acknowledged that this is a somewhat odd document. It's a
somewhat odd document because there are several audiences that it
needs to inform, but these audiences are somewhat diverse, ranging
from texturing artists to writers working on player-driven plot-lines.

In keeping with this mixed-usage model, many of the people who read
this document will not need to read the entire document. Artists, for
example, are encouraged to read the overviews in
Chapter~\ref{chapt:overview} before jumping to the portfolios portion
of this document (Chapter~\ref{chapt:portfolios}), but may find little
use for much of Chapter~\ref{chapt:timelines}'s treatment of VSU
timelines. That said, those looking to do any addtional fleshing out
of the framework are strongly-advised to read the whole document with
some degree of attention before considering such an undertaking.

This document aims to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide sufficient cosmology and rules for the VS universe that
  some intuition of what is and is not likely to be canon can
  develop. This includes delineating where we are taking liberties
  with physics and where we are holding firm to our grip on
  reality. Moreover, this delineation must be addressed twice - once
  for the purposes of creating and editing fiction, and again for the
  artistic representations, which may not always correspond exactly to
  the ostensible VS reality (e.g. the VS universe demands that we have
  substantial radiators on starships during the {\it Upon the Coldest
  Sea} time period, but the artistic direction may resolve, on many
  craft, to token radiator surfaces in order to preserve aesthetic and
  other artistic freedoms). Even within these bounds, we must likewise
  be sure to indicate where optimism is assumed and where the VS
  universe makes more pessimistic assumptions.
\item Provide sufficient detail on relevant species, factions, and
  technologies, as they appear in the UtCS setting, that artists can
  become familiar with the subjects they are to portray.
\item Provide both back story and future-history for large-scale
  events, so that those looking to create stories set in the Vega
  Strike universe have both a backdrop to frame their stories in, and
  a set of future events to preemptively constrain continuity.
\end{itemize}

Finally, an important point - at the time of this writing, this
document is far from finished. It is not polished, it is not, in some
places, even fully skeletal. This document will change over time. The
odds approach certainty that some pieces of it will eventually require
retconning and others will be missed during various changes that
should have retconned them and become desynchronized. Still, what is
in this document is, even in its unfinished and mercurial state, is
the VS canon until changed, and should not be ignored, skipped over,
or otherwise elided lightly.
