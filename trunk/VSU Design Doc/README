Instructions for building the PDF:

Most newer systems have texlive.
In that case, use this to compile it:
$ make -f Makefile.live

If you have the older tex (base) installed
$ make -f Makefile.base

If you get errors about "subfigure.sty", make sure you have the extras package installed.
On Ubuntu, you can install this with:
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
