The following sections give a holistic overview of various key groups
as the exist or existed circa 3276 CE (i.e. the UtCS period, see
~\ref{timeline:UtCS} and~\ref{exptimeline:UtCS}), combining factional, species, and aesthetic
information in a single place, from an omniscient viewpoint. These
portfolios are primarily designed to give insight and direction to
artists and other content creators. Much of the information here may
be duplicated elsewhere. There may be cases where the omniscient
viewpoint and in-game viewpoint disagree. Such disagreements are
likely intentional, reflecting misconceptions or ignorances on the
part of the extant groups. In cases where the disagreements seem more
ambiguous or unlikely in intent, please feel free to direct questions
as necessary.
