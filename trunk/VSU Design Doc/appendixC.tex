FADE IN:

1 INT. - BLACK BACKGROUND 							1

Uniform black space, MOS.

TEXT: "BEFORE SUCCESS" in white FADES IN.
BEAT.
TEXT: "COMES SURVIVAL" FADES IN.

All text FADES OUT.

SOUND FADES IN. The MUSIC yields a feeling of
SUSPENSE--'the CALM BEFORE the STORM'.

A SILENT CASCADE OF GOLDEN COINS begins to fall FORWARD and
AWAY from the camera as if it were pointing down, in SLOW
MOTION. As the coins tumble down, they catch the light
briefly and send off FLASHES of growing intensity.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Those who see in her all they
lust after, should not
forget...

As the NARRATOR speaks,

DISSOLVE IN (OVERLAY,  SCREEN,
FADED EDGES, TOP-RIGHT CORNER):

1A EXT. - ALIEN WORLD - DAWN 						1A

LONG SHOT of an ASTRONAUT planting a FLAG on the ground.
Beyond him, past the UNEARTHLY ROCK SHAPES, the STARRY SKY
is clearly visible through the THIN ATMOSPHERE, which
becomes a tenous band of light that meets the RAISING SUN
in the horizon.

DISSOLVE IN (SIMILAR OVERLAY, BOTTOM RIGHT):

1B INT. - A LUMINOUS CHAMBER - DAY 					1B

CLOSE UP ON MEDAL shining on an UNIFORMED CHEST, below
HIGH-RANK INSIGNIA(s). Previous overlay DISSOLVES OUT. BEAT.

2.

DISSOLVE IN (OVERLAY, BOTTOM-LEFT):

1C INT. - TROPHY WALL - DAY 							1C

SLOW TRACKING SHOT along a wall covered by FRAMED PICTURES
of WELL-DRESSED characters and NEWSPAPER CLIPS, AWARDS and
TROPHIES while the previous overlay DISSOLVES OUT. A place
of honor is given to an ENLARGED MAGAZINE COVER that reads
"SpaceTIME: MAN OF THE LIGHT-YEAR".

DISSOLVE IN (OVERLAY, TOP-LEFT):

1D INT. - IN FRONT OF FIREPLACE - AFTERNOON

CLOSE UP of TWO WINE GLASSES CLINKING. Previous overlay
DISSOLVES OUT.

BEAT. Last overlay DISSOLVES OUT.

The coin flashes have become so intense that they're almost
blinding now. A last coin causes a

BRIGHT-WHITE FLASH TO:

2 EXT. - PLANET ORBIT - NIGHT 						2

HAND HELD/CLOSE UP of an AERAN FIGHTER'S HULL.
MUSIC KICKS UP suddenly into HIGHER GEAR. ZOOM OUT to
HANDHELD RUNNING SHOT of a WING of AERA FIGHTERS speeding
across a CONFED FLEET, which is composed of countless
CAPITAL SHIPS and CONFED FIGHTERS darting past the camera.
Nearby BLASTS of ARTILLERY FIRE SHAKE the frame violently.
The Aera fighters climb, then dive as they dodge ARTILLERY
FIRE and strike a CONFED CAPITAL SHIP, the hull of which
FLASHES as it takes the hits.
CUT TO:
3 EXT. - PLANET ORBIT - CONTINUING ACTION 				3

LONG SHOT, MOS. SLOW PAN TO THE RIGHT across the
battlefield where the two fleets battle over the shining
blue world. Capital ships in both sides seem to perform a
slow yet complex choreography. Their dark shapes are only
lit by ephemeral, SOUNDLESS FLASHES OF GUNFIRE and BLASTS.
Endless streams of TRACER SHOTS fly in all directions.
Fighters are mere fireflies rushing back and forth.
3.

SMASH CUT TO:

4 EXT. - ORBITAL STATION OVER PLANET - TWILIGHT 			4

MUSIC has STOPPED. EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the MIRRORLIKE
FACEPLATE of an EVA SUIT under a COLD LIGHT. The planet,
FIRE and EXPLOSIONS are reflected upon its surface for a
moment, then FADE OUT, leaving the faceplate BLANK while
SCENE LIGHTING SHIFTS into HOT RED hues. MUSIC STARTS
again, growing more and more OMINOUS. The HELMET is
rotating away from the camera, revealing CRACKS in the
glass and STREAKS and SPATTERS of DRIED BLOOD that flowed
out from them.

5 FULL-BODY, CONTINUING 							5

The suit is clearly meant for a humanoid occupant. Parts of
it have been ripped away. The exposed FLESH appears FROZEN,
its surface disfigured by DARK GAPING HOLES.

6 LONG SHOT 									6

The suit is little more than a floating white speck near a
DEVASTATED, DESERTED STATION. A ruined Confed CAPITAL of
type seen in battle appears near the TWISTED FRAMEWORK of
the DOCK surrounded by DEBRIS. Below, the GLOWING RED
CRESENCT that is the planet appears as if on fire.

MUSIC STOPS.
