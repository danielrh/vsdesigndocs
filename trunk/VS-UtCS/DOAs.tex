\subsection{Unlocks}
Battles happening during the timeline of the UtCS campaigns will be unlocked when they are in at least one Player Character's past.

\subsection{Small-scale Combat Trainer}
\subsubsection{Synopsis}
Flexible scenario wherein the player has limited control over the number and type of both allied and enemy flightgroups. Maximum number of capital elements on each side is fixed at a low number, although type is selectable. Likewise for strike elements, except with much higher cap. Setting parameters (system, fleet starting locations, neutral elements) are fixed.

\end{center}
\subsubsection{Wide-angle Synopsis}
The Aera have invaded the Union of Dispossessed Settlers seeking to
carve a path through human space to the coreward regions of the jump
network. The Confederation of Inhabited Worlds lends increasingly
direct aid while the Forsaken are driven further and further back in
what are clearly little more than delaying actions against the far
superior Aeran forces.

\begin{center}
{\it Mourn, England, mourn and complain

\end{center}
\subsubsection{Wide-angle Synopsis}
An official state of war is reached between the Confederation and the
Aeran Ascendancy. The Aeran-Human border is ablaze with combat, and
many Human border worlds are lost or compromised as the Aera strike
first. Shmrn space is invaded, and the Andolian 9th fleet, sent to aid
the Shmrn, is cut off. Victories by the Andolian 6th fleet, and
Confederation 4th fleet blunt the Aeran advance on the Spinward front,
but at significant cost in men and materiel. Aeran forces penetrate
deeply on the center front, while much of the anti-spinward front is
pushed to near collapse, save for pockets of bypassed Forsaken
worlds. Confederation forces resort to scorched earth policies in many
systems still belonging to the LIHW or Union of Dispossessed Settlers,
completely abandoning the Diaspora sector, and regroup in more
sustainable positions. Confederation fleets engage the Aerans in
skirmishes and strikes throughout the center front, with profound
carnage on both sides. Andolian counter-attacks all but eject the Aera
from Shmrn space, reestablishing direct communications with the
Uln. Andolian forces begin a methodical incursion into Aeran space on
the spinward front, relieving some pressure from the anti-spinward
front as the Aera redistribute their forces. The Rlaan watch intently,
hoping to be able to avoid intervening, while putting significant
effort into expanding their coreward possessions while humanity is busy
fighting the Aera.

\begin{center}
{\it Gaudete, gaudete! Liber est natus ex machina sapiens, gaudete!

Gaudete, gaudete! Liber est natus ex post-homo paternus, gaudete!}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Wide-angle Synopsis}
The Andolians and the A.I. Quorum unveil the Grandchildren, the fruit
of decades of research and material investment. A new class of
thinking machines, designed explicitly with military application in
mind (indeed, it is generally assumed by all other parties that they
were originally designed for use against or for leverage with the
other human polities), vast multitudes of Grandchildren, in the form
of a veritable armada, issue forth from inside the hollows of
Hephaestus, and begin an all out invasion of Aeran space. Taking
advantage of wartime powers granted by the Confederation Senate in
unintended fashion, the Andolians allow their Special Forces
operatives to wage an unrestricted campaign against the Interstellar
Church of True Form's Return without fear of Purist legal
entanglement. The major Confederation powers play king-maker among the
less than reputable and less than legal organizations, bringing in
from the cold those entities willing to assist the war effort, and
removing from existence any competitors less eager to be of service,
such as the Order of the Dynast Shrub. Some of these actions deeply
anger various Ulnish clans, but the proximity of several fleets to Uln
space deters overt action, and retribution takes the form of Uln
relaying of intelligence to the Aera. The Simons are employed in
overthrowing the corrupt, and externally funded leadership of the ISO
as a precursor to instigating coordinated guerrilla actions from the
pockets of Forsaken worlds behind the Aeran lines. Shaper forces make
their first real impact of the war, as troopships full of Shaper Hulks
are dispatched alongside Mechanist and Purth forces to reclaim worlds
fallen to the Aera. The initial engagements by the Grandchildren are
stunning victories, greatly demoralizing the Aeran forces, and
disrupting their efforts to concentrate their fleets.

\subsection{Act 4: The sea on fire}
\begin{center}
{\it ... [it] will not start a chain-reaction in the water converting it all to gas and letting the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom. It will not blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole. It will not destroy gravity ... } 

Admiral William Blandy on Ivy Mike
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Wide-angle Synopsis}
As the Grandchildren produce an increasingly impressive set of
victories from the Spinward front and ever deeper into Aeran space,
the progress on the other fronts is much slower. Aeran raiding parties
continue to harass and impede. The Forsaken guerrilla attacks, while
marvelous as a delaying tactic, can no longer be sustained, as the
Aeran response has destroyed all remaining Forsaken colonies behind
the front. Especially troubling, an unexpected Confederation defeat,
due more to distrust and negligent communication than individual
incompetence, coupled with the deployment of the Ascendancy's Leonidas
class dreadnought reserves, has opened up Vega sector to Aeran
assault, and many long developed worlds have been raided, threatened,
and attacked. With the devastation being wrought by the Grandchildren,
the Aera are increasingly desperate to either lure the Confederation
into ill-planned action via destruction of ancestral worlds, or to
construct a deep enough corridor that a spread of colony convoys may
be launched in a last-ditch attempt to bypass Human space primarily
via SPEC, retreading the waters that started the Rlaan-Aeran
war. Fighting on the front becomes especially fierce, as both sides
commit themselves deeply to each fray. Domestic Confederation politics
boils and froths as assorted scandals are rooted out when entities are
no longer capable of focusing the attention necessary to hide them,
and the Andolian Protectorate woos the Shapers into their fold.

\begin{center}
{\it And all that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters}
	
Gordon Lightfoot - The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Wide-angle Synopsis}
With the Grandchildren winning some key decisive victories in Aeran
space, and the incursion into Vega Sector blunted, the long term
outcome for the war seems increasingly likely to be an Aeran
defeat. However, the cataclysms of combat have quieted somewhat as
both sides have exhausted themselves, and any final closure is surely
years, if not decades away, leaving much time for potential
reversals. The Rlaan are the obvious short-term beneficiaries, but it
is clear that they are somewhat uneasy about the Grandchildren, having
been taken by surprise by the revelation of their existence. On the
domestic front, the Confederation is undergoing profound political
upheavals. The Highborn have been cowed into silent disgrace as a slew
of rumors about their involvement in illegal activities in Forsaken
space issues forth following an orchestrated series of information
leaks. With the Grandchildren firmly in their camp, the Andolians have
finally found the trump card in their long contest with the Shapers as
to who would helm the march to post-humanism. With the Shapers now
aligned with the Andolians and their traditional allies, the
post-human agenda now dominates the policy-making bodies of the
Confederation. The Forsaken, once again dispossessed, are scheduled to
once again be relocated, but this time will remain under the auspices
of the Confederation, with semi-autonomous status, sharing in the
opportunities available to other humans. As humanity adjusts to both
life during wartime, and the possibility that humanity's children may
be much further on their way to surpassing them than expected, the
first trickle of Aera who have come to believe that the future of
their species may rest in siding with humanity lest they be erased by
it journey to Uln space to conduct the first of a series of
clandestine meetings with Andolian and, later, Confederation agents.
